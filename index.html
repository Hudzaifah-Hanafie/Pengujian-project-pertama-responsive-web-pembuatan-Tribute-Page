                <li><p><strong>1953</strong> - Began teaching at Anjiang Agricultural School in Hunan Province</p></li>
                <li><p><strong>1960</strong> - Motivated by the Great Famine, began focusing on hybrid rice; discovered a wild hybrid rice stalk</p></li>
                <li><p><strong>1964 (Jul 5)</strong> - Identified a naturally male-sterile rice plant, enabling large-scale hybrid breeding</p></li>
                <li><p><strong>1966 (Feb)</strong> - Published his first major paper on rice male sterility in Science Bulletin</p></li>
                <li><p><strong>1972–1973</strong> - Led national research efforts; developed the first “three-line” hybrid rice system; Oct 1973 published success</p></li>
                <li><p><strong>1974</strong> - First high-yield hybrid rice variety (“Nanyou 2”) achieved 20% higher yields than traditional varieties</p></li>
                <li><p><strong>1975–1976</strong> - Statewide adoption began; by 1976, demonstration covered 2.08 million mu; by 1988 hybrid rice covered ~39.6% of rice fields</p></li>
                <li><p><strong>1979</strong> - Hybrid rice technology introduced to the U.S., marking China’s first IP transfer abroad</p></li>
                <li><p><strong>1981</strong> - Awarded China's first National Special Invention Award for indica hybrid rice</p></li>
                <li><p><strong>1987</strong> - His team discovered photoperiod-sensitive male sterility, enabling more efficient “two-line” hybrid system</p></li>
                <li><p><strong>1991</strong> - Became chief consultant to the UN’s FAO</p></li>
                <li><p><strong>1995</strong> - Elected to the Chinese Academy of Engineering</p></li>
                <li><p><strong>2000</strong> - Received China’s State Preeminent Science and Technology Award</p></li>
                <li><p><strong>2004</strong> - Awarded both the Wolf Prize in Agriculture and the World Food Prize</p></li>
                <li><p><strong>2006</strong> - Elected foreign associate of the U.S. National Academy of Sciences</p></li>

                <li><p><strong>2012–2013</strong> - Developed “super‑hybrid” rice with yields approaching 1 ton per mu; 2013 variety hit 988.1 kg/mu</p></li>
                <li><p><strong>2017</strong> - Set new world record: 1,149 kg/mu</p></li>
                <li><p><strong>2019</strong> - Awarded the Medal (Order) of the Republic, China’s highest honor</p></li>
                <li><p><strong>2020–2021</strong> - Advanced “third-generation” hybrid rice to annual yields of ~1,500 kg/mu; worked on salt-tolerant rice initiatives</p></li>
                <li><p><strong>2021 (May 22)</strong> - Dies at age of 90</p></li>
